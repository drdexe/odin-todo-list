### [The Odin Project: Todo List](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-todo-list)

Todo App that groups todo lists by project. By default, "Main" project is created.

Each todo can have an optional description, due date, and priority. You can click on a todo to view its desciption, mark the todo as complete, edit its details, or delete it.

The due date is formatted using the [date-fns](https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns) module. Documentation [here](https://date-fns.org/docs/Getting-Started).

`localStorage` is used to preserve projects and todos even when the page is reloaded.
